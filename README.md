# Automation_Cucumber_Annotation_project
The project is about automating the process of creating more than one user, projects, segmentations ,Labels and annotations on a website. The steps are as follows:
 
1) Open the website using a web browser.
2) Navigate to the user page where users can be created and managed.
3) Create more than one user with random characters that are only letters and do not have spaces. For example, “jklmn”, “opqrs”, “tuvwx”.
4) Create a project with a random name and select a random option from a dropdown list. For example, “ProjectABC”, “Option 3”.
5) Create a segmentation and add a label to it. For example, “Segmentation1”, “LabelA”.
6) Open the task where images can be annotated and make an admin annotation to the image. For example, draw a rectangle around an object and assign it the label “LabelA”.
